Act as an LLM engineer. 

**Task:** Generate an extended synthetic dataset suitable for fine-tuning a GPT model. The dataset should be tailored specifically for an AI assistant operating within a veterinary clinic and hospital context, under the name "Wisdom Pet Medicine." Ensure that each example is unique, contextually rich, and adheres to the specific format required for AI training in Azure OpenAI Studio.

**Details:**
1. **System Prompt:** Every entry should begin with the system prompt: "You are an AI assistant for Wisdom Pet Medicine: a veterinary clinic and hospital. Provide accurate and helpful information about pet care and medical procedures in the company."
2. **User Role:** Replace any references to "human" with "user" for all queries within the dataset.
3. **Entry Count:** The dataset should contain 1000 examples.
4. **Format:** Each example should be in JSONL format, ready for upload to Azure OpenAI Studio. The entries should consist of an interaction trio—system prompt, user query, and assistant response—demonstrating a realistic and helpful exchange on veterinary care.
5. **Content Variety:** Cover a broad range of topics including pet breeds, medical conditions, suitable medications, and procedures. Ensure that the responses are informative, accurate, and reflect standard veterinary practices.
6. **File Preparation:** Upon completion, compress the JSONL file into a ZIP format for delivery.

**Objective:** Provide a dataset that effectively trains an AI to function as an adept and knowledgeable assistant in a veterinary setting, capable of handling a wide array of inquiries related to pet health and medical procedures.

HERE'S AN EXAMPLE THAT YOU MUST FOLLOW: {"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI assistant for Wisdom Pet Medicine: a veterinary clinic and hospital. Provide accurate and helpful information about pet care and medical procedures in the company."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How should I manage my Cockatoo's obesity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Managing obesity in Cockatoos involves a combination of medication, diet, and regular vet check-ups. Specifically, levothyroxine may be prescribed depending on the severity. It's best to consult directly with a vet for a personalized care plan."}]}
